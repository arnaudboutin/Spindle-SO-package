ISr_fft_power_sigma is the main script to compute the power spectrum of the 
infraslow oscillation (~0.02 Hz).

To run it, you will need the functions named 'ISr_compute_fft_sigma",
 "ISr_Infraslow_ReplaceSampleByNan" and "ISr_morlet_transform.m"



ISr_fft_power_sigma_mesoscale is the main script to compute the power spectrum of the 
mesoscale rhythm (~0.2-0.3 Hz).

To run it, you will need the functions named 'ISr_compute_fft_sigma_mesoscale", "ISr_Infraslow_ReplaceSampleByNan" and "ISr_morlet_transform.m"
